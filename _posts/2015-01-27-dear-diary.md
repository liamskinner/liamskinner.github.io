Dear Diary, how the hay has been
Dear Diary, it's been just like a meme
Woke up too ate, wasn't where I would have been
For goodness sake
What's happening to he?
Write lightly, yours truly, dear Diary
It was cold outside my door
So many people by the score
Rushing around so senselessly
They don't notice there's people like me
Write lightly, yours truly, dear Diary
They don't know what they're playing
No, they've no way of knowing what the game is
Still they carry on
Doing what they can
Outside me, impolitely, dear Diary
It's over, will tomorrow be the same?
I know that they're really not to blame
If they weren't so blind then surely they'd see
There's a much better way for them to be
Inside me, yours truly, dear Diary
Dear Diary, it was cold today
But the sun came out later
So I went out and strolled about looking at the shops
Didn't really see anything I liked so I didn't buy anything
On the way home I posted a letter
Been quite a nice day
Somebody exploded an H-bomb today
But it wasn't anybody I knew


this is an amazing song check out lyrics
